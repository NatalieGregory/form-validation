# Client Side Form Validation

## Simple Validtion
1. Submit button should be disabled if fields are blank
2. If any required fields are blanks, prevent the form from posting and
   add an error message to the top of the form.
3. If the form has errors, add and style and error class to append to
   all invalid fields.
